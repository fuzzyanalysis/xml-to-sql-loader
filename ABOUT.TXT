This is a tool that was specifically designed for reading in .xml files 
from the GCIDE project and putting them into a database.

It is proposed that this tool will eventually allow multiple database types to 
read in the ENglish words (and hopefully other languages) to create data sources 
that be used for text mining purposes and other text lookup functions.
